Purpose:
This Shopify app helps merchants increase their Average Order Value (AOV) by using AI to automatically create and optimize upsell offers and smart product bundles. The app analyzes store data and customer behavior to recommend bundles and upsells that are likely to convert.

👤 Who is it for?



It’s for Shopify store owners who:
• Want to increase their revenue from every customer
• Don’t have the time or expertise to manually create product bundles and upsells
• Are tired of generic apps that require lots of configuration or don’t convert well



Examples of users:
• A clothing brand that wants to bundle matching accessories with outfits
• A pet supplies store that wants to upsell treats when someone buys dog food
• A beauty store that wants to suggest a “complete skincare set” when a serum is added to cart

🚀 What does it actually do?



Once the app is installed, it does the heavy lifting:
1. Scans store data — Looks at customer behavior, purchase history, and product metadata.
2. Creates “Smart Bundles” — Groups products that tend to be bought together or complement each other.
3. Sets Up “Smart Upsells” — Adds in-cart and post-purchase suggestions for other relevant products.
4. Optimizes offers using AI — Tracks what works and makes adjustments automatically over time.
5. Shows performance metrics — Store owners can see how much extra revenue is being generated.



👉 All this happens with minimal setup. It’s designed to be “install-and-go.”

💡 What problem does it solve?



Shopify merchants constantly struggle to:
• Increase average order value (AOV)
• Know which products to upsell or bundle
• Set up upsells manually or test different versions



This app automates those tasks using AI—helping merchants make more money with less effort.

We charge merchants a monthly subscription, based on how big their store is.



Example Pricing:
• $9/month – For small stores
• $29/month – For medium stores (unlimited upsells, basic AI)
• $79/month – For large stores (advanced A/B testing, premium AI, analytics)



We might also offer a free trial (7-14 days) and a performance-based pricing option for big merchants (like 1% of upsell revenue generated).
